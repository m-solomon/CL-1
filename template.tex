I am writing to apply for the \textbf{\textit{student assistant position for efficient rendering in post- production, gaming and virtual reality applications (Ref\#: 413080)}} advertised on your website. I was very intrigued when I read what you wrote about light-field technology and its applications in film and television production, as it is not only very much aligned with my technical background but also with my passions, and I am very keen on contributing to the ongoing research in this field.

My technical background includes working on two projects during my undergraduate studies (junior and senior projects) that heavily involved digital image processing. For my Junior Project, I designed a Rubik's cube solving robot that recognizes the colors on each face of the cube then solves it within 3 seconds. For my Senior Project, I proposed to design an autonomous UAV that was able to recognize its landing pad by taking multiple images and controlling the UAV until the landing pad is in the center of the image, this approach was meant to compensate for the subtle inaccuracies of GPS coordination. 

In my last semester as a bachelor student, I also assisted in an undergraduate research project on the performance of a new patch-based image denoising algorithm that showed promising results with low-resolution images, my role was to propose different approaches to reduce the computations of the algorithm when applied on high-resolution images.

My academic credentials include a BS degree in Electrical Engineering with emphasis on DSP and an in-progress MS degree at FAU in computational engineering with emphasis on IT and DSP, which I am expected to complete in three semesters from now. During my bachelor studies, I extensively used Matlab and Python and strengthened my skills in writing efficient codes and algorithms. Moreover, I am currently enhancing my skills in C++ as it is an important part of my Master's studies.

Besides my technical background, I have a tremendous passion for photography and filmmaking, and this passion has a been a great motivation in my studies, as I have always wanted to be part of advancing the film/entertainment industry and pushing the boundaries of the artistic medium of motion pictures, and I would greatly welcome the chance to join the efforts of your department in doing so.

I wish to hear from you soon and hopefully schedule a meeting with your team.\hspace{3cm} Thank you for your time.
